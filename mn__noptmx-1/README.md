# pest_runfiles

The purpose of this repo is to hold only the *bare minimum* files needed to support a Pest++ run. There are no weather data files here. Those need to be uploaded separately. There is no zipped Python environment. That also needs to be kept out of version control and uploaded separately. With respect to Python, there is a 'minimal_env.yml' file that can be used with a working mambaforge installation by typing `mamba env create -f minimal_env.yml`.
